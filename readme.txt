---------------------------------------steps--------------------------------------------------------
1. Set up the project:
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` and follow the prompts.
   - Install necessary dependencies using `npm install express mongoose dotenv`.

2. Create the project structure:
   - Create the main server file, `index.js`.
   - Create a `models` directory to store the database models.
   - Create a `routes` directory to define the Express routes.
   - Create a `views` directory to store the EJS templates.
   - Create a `public` directory for static assets like CSS and client-side JavaScript.

3. Set up MongoDB connection:
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account (or use a local MongoDB installation).
   - Obtain the connection string and store it in a `.env` file.
   - In your `index.js` file, require the necessary dependencies and establish a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose.

4. Create the List model:
   - Inside the `models` directory, create a `List.js` file.
   - Define the schema and model for the List collection using Mongoose.

5. Create the Task model:
   - Inside the `models` directory, create a `Task.js` file.
   - Define the schema and model for the Task collection using Mongoose.
   - Add a reference to the List model to establish a relationship between lists and tasks.

6. Define the routes:
   - Inside the `routes` directory, create a `listRoutes.js` file.
   - Define the Express routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting lists and tasks.
   - Use the List and Task models to interact with the database.

7. Implement the controllers:
   - Create a `controllers` directory to store the route handlers.
   - Inside the `controllers` directory, create a `listController.js` file.
   - Implement the route handlers for CRUD operations using the List and Task models.

8. Design the views:
   - Inside the `views` directory, create EJS templates for rendering the UI.
   - Create templates for displaying lists, tasks, and their respective forms.
   - Use EJS templating syntax to dynamically render data from the server.

9. Set up static assets:
   - Place your CSS stylesheets and client-side JavaScript files in the `public` directory.
   - Link the CSS and JavaScript files in your EJS templates.

10. Set up the server:
   - In your `index.js` file, configure Express, set up the routes, and start the server.
   - Use middleware like `express.urlencoded` and `express.static` to handle form submissions and serve static files.

11. Test and run the app:
   - Start the server using `node index.js` or `npm start`.
   - Open your web browser and access the app at the specified URL.
   - Test the TODO List app by creating lists, adding tasks, and performing CRUD operations.

This outline provides a high-level overview of building a basic TODO List app. Remember to refer to the official documentation of the used libraries (such as Express, Mongoose, and EJS) for detailed instructions on how to use them effectively.

Express is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. It provides a set of features and utilities to handle routing, middleware, request handling, and response generation, making it easier to build robust and scalable web applications.

Here are some reasons why Express is commonly used in Node.js web development:

1. **Routing**: Express provides a simple and intuitive way to define routes for handling different HTTP methods and URLs. It allows you to handle various types of requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and define the corresponding actions to be performed.

2. **Middleware**: Express middleware functions allow you to modify request and response objects, execute code before routing, handle authentication, logging, error handling, and more. Middleware functions can be added globally or specific to certain routes, providing flexibility in handling various aspects of the request/response lifecycle.

3. **Template Engines**: Express supports integration with template engines like EJS, Pug, and Handlebars, which help in generating dynamic HTML pages by combining static markup with dynamic data. This allows you to render dynamic views and provide a more interactive experience to users.

4. **Static File Serving**: Express makes it easy to serve static files such as CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets. You can specify a static directory and let Express handle the serving of files, making it convenient to organize and serve client-side resources.

5. **Error Handling**: Express provides built-in error handling mechanisms, allowing you to define error-handling middleware functions to catch and handle errors that occur during request processing. This helps in providing meaningful error messages and preventing the application from crashing due to unhandled exceptions.

6. **Integration with other libraries**: Express has a large and active ecosystem with many third-party libraries and middleware available. It integrates well with other popular libraries like Passport for authentication, Mongoose for MongoDB integration, and Socket.io for real-time communication.

Overall, Express simplifies the development of web applications in Node.js by providing a lightweight framework with essential features and a clear and concise API. It allows developers to focus on building application logic rather than dealing with low-level details of handling HTTP requests and managing server-side operations.
